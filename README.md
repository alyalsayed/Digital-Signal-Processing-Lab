# Digital Signal Processing with MATLAB

This project involves implementing digital signal processing techniques using MATLAB.
There are three tasks in this project.

## Task 1: Butterworth Filters
In this task, we plot the frequency response and impulse response of Butterworth filters with n = 4 and n = 21. The filters have a bandpass with cutoff frequencies of fc1=200 and fc2=2000 Hz. The sampling rate for this task is 10 kHz.

## Task 2:  Filter a record from a whistle 
In this task, we work with an audio file named "whistle.wav". We read this file into MATLAB and specify the number of samples and time of recording in seconds. We then plot the frequency spectrum of the signal x and identify any peaks. Next, we design a filter to reject sinusoidal signals from signal x. After designing the filter, we plot its frequency response and impulse response and check its stability. Finally, we plot the frequency spectrum of signal y, which is the output of the filter, and play the output signal to determine if the whistle is still present. We also calculate the energy for the original signal and the filtered signal.

## Task 3: Filters
In this task, we plot the frequency response and impulse response of two filters. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project involved implementing digital signal processing techniques using MATLAB. We plotted frequency and impulse responses of Butterworth filters, designed a stop filter to remove sinusoidal signals, and analyzed the frequency and impulse responses of two other filters.
